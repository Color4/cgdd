<p> The Cancer Genetic Dependencies Database (CancerGD) provides a search interface to genetic dependencies identified in loss-of-function screens in panels of tumour cell lines. A genetic dependency is identified when there is a statistical association in a panel of cell lines between the presence of a particular mutation and the sensitivity to the inhibition of a gene. These dependencies are identified by integrating large-scale loss-of-function screens in panels of cell lines with genotype data for the same cell lines. We store all nominally significant dependencies (P &lt; 0.05) with a common language effect size &gt; 65%. In order to facilitate follow on studies we have annotated all dependencies in the database according to the availaibility of inhibitors for the target genes. A goal of this database is to help understand genetic dependencies in the context of known functional interaction networks (e.g. protein-protein interactions). Towards this end we have developed simple functionality to identify those genetic dependencies that occur <strong>within pathways</strong> (i.e. where the driver gene and the target dependency belong to the same pathway) and <strong>between pathways</strong> (i.e. where the dependencies associated with a given driver gene belong to the same complex or pathway as each other). This is inspired by <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15877074" title="Yeast Genetic Interaction Interpretation">work in yeast</a> that used the same categories to interpret genetic interactions. </p>

<p> Here we provide a walk through of the database, showing the steps required to identify and interpret the dependencies associated with <em>ERBB2</em> amplification in <a href="http://www.cell.com/cell-reports/fulltext/S2211-1247(16)30126-7" title="Campbell, Ryan et al, Cell Reports">Campbell <i> et al.</i></a> resource published in Cell Reports<p>

<p> First type <em>'ERBB2'</em> into the <b>Driver gene</b> field. Select <i/>'Pan cancer'</i> as the <b>Tissue Type</b> and <i>'Campbell(2016)'</i> as the <b>Study</b>. Clicking 'Search' will then retrieve all of the dependencies associated with <i>ERBB2</i> amplification from the <a href="http://www.cell.com/cell-reports/fulltext/S2211-1247(16)30126-7" title="Campbell, Ryan et al, Cell Reports">Campbell <i> et al.</i> </a> resource published in Cell Reports. </p>

<p> The resulting table displays the nominally significant (p &lt; 0.05) dependencies associated with the selected driver gene (<i>ERBB2</i>) in the selected tissue (pan-cancer, i.e. across all tissue types) from the selected study (Campbell <em>et al</em>). You can sort this table by clicking the toggles in the header row. For most columns it is also possible to filter using the plain text forms or drop-down menus at the top of the table. You can download this table as a CSV file (which you can open with Excel or similar application) by clicking the 'Download as CSV file' button above the table.  </p>

<p> Clicking on any gene name in the table opens up a box-plot displaying the data supporting the association between the driver alteration and that gene. Below we show the box plot associated with <i>MAP2K3</i> (third line in the table). For a full explanation of these box plots please see the FAQ. Each circle in the box plot represents a cell line and colour indicates tissue of origin, as described in the legend to the right of the box plot. It is possible to hide/show the cell lines from specific tissue types by checking/unchecking the tick box beside each tissue in the legend table. Hovering over a circle in the box plot will show the name of that cell line. A high-resolution image containing the box plot can be downloaded by clicking on the Download boxplot as <b>' PNG image'</b> button, and an accompanying legend downloaded by clicking Download legend for <b>'selected tissues'</b>. The data supporting the dependency (RNAi sensitivity scores and mutational status for each cell line) can be downloaded by clicking the Download boxplot as <b>'CSV file'</b> button.  </p>

<p> One of the goals of this database is to facilitate the interpretation of genetic dependencies and to develop filters to prioritise promising candidates for follow up studies. The simplest approach is to focus on dependencies that have a known relationship with the driver gene. To identify these - choose <em>'Any'</em> in the <em>'String Interaction'</em> column. This will filter the table to show only the genetic dependencies that have a functional relationship (e.g. protein-protein interaction) with the driver-gene. These functional relationships are obtained from the <a href="http://string-db.org/" title="STRING-db">STRING database</a>. Clicking on text inside this column (e.g. <em>Highest</em>) will bring the user to the STRING database where the data supporting the functional interaction between the driver gene and the dependency will be displayed.</p>

<p> An alternative to identifying the known functional interactions betwen the driver gene and the dependencies is to try to understand the interactions between all of the dependencies. In this way it may be possible to identify pathways or protein complexes that the the driver gene is associated with an increased dependency upon. For this analysis we rely on the <a href="http://string-db.org/" title="STRING-db">STRING database</a>. To view all of the interactions between the dependencies associated with a given driver gene click on the <b>'Strindb Image'</b> button above the table. In this example this will retrieve an image showing the high-confidence functional interactions between the genes identified as <em>ERBB2</em> dependencies. You can see that <em>ERBB2</em> amplification is associated with an increased dependency upon a group of kinases functionally related to <em>ERBB2</em> and <em>PI3K</em> signaling, as well as a group of genes involved in map kinase signaling. </p>

<p> You can explore the STRING interaction network further on the STRING site. This will allow you see the evidence supporting the links between each of the dependencies, and also to filter the network to display higher/lower confidence interactions. To do this click on the 'Stringdb Interactive' button and you will be brought to the STRING site. </p>
